deskripsi: 'Helpsters / created by Tim McKeon for Sesame Workshop and Apple TV+. /
  Cody and the Helpsters are a team of monsters who love to solve problems. Whether
  it''s planning a party or mastering a magic trick, the Helpsters can figure anything
  out - because everything starts with a plan. "For years now, I have designed characters
  who have lived their lives amongst the pages of books, but now, I will watch as
  characters I have designed literally come to life on screen (Scatter performed by
  Tim Lagasse and Mr. Primm performed by Martin Robinson). Thanks to the incredible
  people at MonkeyBoys Productions, myself and Dan Cook were awarded the dream job
  of designing puppets for Tim McKeon’s Helpsters." — Jeremy Accolades: Nominated
  for 5 Emmys (2019), Parent''s Choice Award (2020)'
